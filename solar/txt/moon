The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth largest satellite
in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet,
with a diameter about one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia).
The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a
satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[17] It lacks any
significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about
one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with Jupiter's moon Io being the only satellite in
the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.
