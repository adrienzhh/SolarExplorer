Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around
the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman
god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and
mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes. Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's
orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never
exceeds 28.
